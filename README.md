# CMI---270-Commands-Insane-Kits-Portals-Essentials-Economy-MySQL-SqLite-Much-More-
This plugin is made to be all in one plugin for server management and replace multiple outdated plugins. It can fully replace Essentials/EssentialsX and contains simple conversion commands to transfer old player data to new system. It offers more features than you expect and provides most needed tools for creating your own unique server with new game mechanics. Features ranging from basic ones, like heal, to most advanced ones, like kit editors ingame, item finder across all possible containers, portal systems, self updating signs on so on. Why its 15 Euro? Because its worth 150, but that would be too much to ask :) Just check review section if you have any doubt about this plugin.

CMI Bungee plugin can be downloaded from HERE
Economy: For CMI economy to properly work you will need one of two solutions:
1. Is to use recompiled Vault version from HERE which has direct support for CMI economy and will have the best compatibility with other plugins.
2. Use economy injector from HERE which will add CMI economy support to any Vault build.
Both methods are valid but second one can have small issues with plugins which would tend to load straight after Vault loads and before injector himself.
P.S. Don't forget to enable Economy in a config file.

Having issues? Do you have a new feature suggestion? Create ticket over GitHub for simple and easy tracking for me and for anyone who is interested in this plugin growth :)

For geolocation, you will need to have THIS file in CMI folder. In case you want to see players city, use THIS file. Optionally you can enable auto-download in a config file.
